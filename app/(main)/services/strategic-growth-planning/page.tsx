const testimonials = [
  { quote: "Before RealLanding, we were a $12M team running on gut instinct. They built us a 3-year growth plan with quarterly milestones, a hiring roadmap, and a geographic expansion strategy. We hit $31M in year two — a number I never would have set for myself without their data showing it was possible. The quarterly reviews kept us honest and moving forward.", author: "Marcus Whitfield", role: "Broker/Owner, Whitfield Realty Group, Dallas TX" },
  { quote: "I was stuck at 40 transactions a year for three years straight. RealLanding&apos;s growth assessment showed me I was leaving $400K on the table by not having a buyer&apos;s agent and by ignoring the new-construction segment. Within 14 months of implementing the plan, I closed 78 transactions and added two agents to my team. The clarity alone was worth 10x the investment.", author: "Lauren Fujimoto", role: "Team Lead, Fujimoto & Associates, Portland OR" },

const faqs = [
  { question: "Who needs strategic growth planning?", answer: "Any real estate professional who wants to scale intentionally — whether you're a solo agent looking to build a team, a team leader aiming to double production, or a broker planning to open a new office or expand into new markets. If you've plateaued or are growing but feel chaotic, a structured plan changes everything." },
  { question: "How quickly will I see ROI from a growth plan?", answer: "Most clients see measurable traction within the first 90 days as the immediate-impact action items take effect. Significant revenue growth typically materializes within 6–12 months. Our 89% goal achievement rate at the 12-month mark speaks to the speed and reliability of the process." },
  { question: "What's included in a growth plan?", answer: "A comprehensive plan includes market analysis, SWOT assessment, financial modeling with revenue projections, team structure and hiring roadmap, competitive positioning strategy, geographic expansion analysis (if applicable), quarterly KPI dashboards, and a 90-day sprint roadmap with weekly action items." },
  { question: "How does growth planning work with my existing business plan?", answer: "If you have an existing plan, we audit it against current market data and your actual performance to identify gaps and missed opportunities. We then enhance or rebuild it with data-driven projections and actionable strategies. Most clients find their existing plans are either outdated, too vague, or lacking the financial and competitive analysis needed to be truly actionable." },
  { question: "Do I need a certain team size to benefit?", answer: "Not at all. We work with solo agents doing $3M in volume all the way up to 50+ agent brokerages doing $500M+. The strategies scale to your situation — a solo agent's plan focuses on building the foundation for a team, while a large brokerage's plan may focus on market share, recruiting, and operational efficiency." },
  { question: "How much does strategic growth planning cost?", answer: "Our growth planning engagements range from $3,500 for a one-time comprehensive plan to $2,000–$5,000/month for ongoing strategy and quarterly review retainers. The investment is calibrated to your business size and complexity. Every client we've worked with has seen multiples of their investment returned in the first year." },
